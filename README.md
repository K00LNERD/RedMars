# RedMars
A decentralised launch pad where you can list and sell your crypto token at a very minimal fee, the purpose of this is to provide projects with low capitals a way to get there token and raise some capital to public before listing on big exchanges


The code is in solidity, the logic is people can come and send there token to us to sell, by creating and campaign, for the campaign to go active the campaigner should atleast have some amount of native redMars tokens, and after getting admin's approval the campaign will go live, now investors can come and pay bnb to buy tokens, the price per token is decided by campaigner,at the end the bnb will be transferred to the campaigner after giving a cut to the admin
